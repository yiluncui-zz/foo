/**
 * Interface for accessing AWSSupport asynchronously.
 * Each asynchronous method will return a Java Future object, and users are also allowed
 * to provide a callback handler.
 * AWS Support <p>
 * The AWS Support API reference is intended for programmers who need
 * detailed information about the AWS Support actions and data types.
 * This service enables you to manage your AWS Support cases
 * programmatically. It uses HTTP methods that return results in JSON
 * format.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The AWS Support service also exposes a set of
 * <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/support/trustedadvisor"> Trusted Advisor </a>
 * features. You can retrieve a list of checks and their descriptions,
 * get check results, specify checks to refresh, and get the refresh
 * status of checks.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The following list describes the AWS Support case management actions:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li> <b>Service names, issue categories, and available severity
 * levels. </b> The actions DescribeServices and DescribeSeverityLevels
 * enable you to obtain AWS service names, service codes, service
 * categories, and problem severity levels. You use these values when you
 * call the CreateCase action. </li>
 * <li> <b>Case creation, case details, and case resolution.</b> The
 * actions CreateCase, DescribeCases, and ResolveCase enable you to
 * create AWS Support cases, retrieve them, and resolve them.</li>
 * <li> <b>Case communication.</b> The actions DescribeCommunications
 * and AddCommunicationToCase enable you to retrieve and add
 * communication to AWS Support cases. </li>
 * 
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The following list describes the actions available from the AWS
 * Support service for Trusted Advisor:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li> DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks returns the list of checks that run
 * against your AWS resources.</li>
 * <li>Using the CheckId for a specific check returned by
 * DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks, you can call
 * DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckResult to obtain the results for the check
 * you specified.</li>
 * <li> DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckSummaries returns summarized results
 * for one or more Trusted Advisor checks.</li>
 * <li> RefreshTrustedAdvisorCheck requests that Trusted Advisor rerun a
 * specified check. </li>
 * <li> DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckRefreshStatuses reports the refresh
 * status of one or more checks. </li>
 * 
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * For authentication of requests, AWS Support uses
 * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html"> Signature Version 4 Signing Process </a>
 * .
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * See the AWS Support
 * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/Welcome.html"> User Guide </a>
 * for information about how to use this service to create and manage
 * your support cases, and how to call Trusted Advisor for results of
 * checks on your resources.
