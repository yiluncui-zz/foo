/**
 * Interface for accessing AmazonDirectConnect asynchronously.
 * Each asynchronous method will return a Java Future object, and users are also allowed
 * to provide a callback handler.
 * <p>
 * AWS Direct Connect makes it easy to establish a dedicated network
 * connection from your premises to Amazon Web Services (AWS). Using AWS
 * Direct Connect, you can establish private connectivity between AWS and
 * your data center, office, or colocation environment, which in many
 * cases can reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput,
 * and provide a more consistent network experience than Internet-based
 * connections.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The AWS Direct Connect API Reference provides descriptions, syntax,
 * and usage examples for each of the actions and data types for AWS
 * Direct Connect. Use the following links to get started using the
 * <i>AWS Direct Connect API Reference</i> :
