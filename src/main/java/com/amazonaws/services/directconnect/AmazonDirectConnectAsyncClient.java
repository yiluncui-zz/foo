/**
 * Asynchronous client for accessing AmazonDirectConnect.
 * All asynchronous calls made using this client are non-blocking. Callers could either
 * process the result and handle the exceptions in the worker thread by providing a callback handler
 * when making the call, or use the returned Future object to check the result of the call in the calling thread.
 * <p>
 * AWS Direct Connect makes it easy to establish a dedicated network
 * connection from your premises to Amazon Web Services (AWS). Using AWS
 * Direct Connect, you can establish private connectivity between AWS and
 * your data center, office, or colocation environment, which in many
 * cases can reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput,
 * and provide a more consistent network experience than Internet-based
 * connections.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The AWS Direct Connect API Reference provides descriptions, syntax,
 * and usage examples for each of the actions and data types for AWS
 * Direct Connect. Use the following links to get started using the
