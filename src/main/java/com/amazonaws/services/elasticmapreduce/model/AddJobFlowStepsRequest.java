/**
 * Container for the parameters to the {@link com.amazonaws.services.elasticmapreduce.AmazonElasticMapReduce#addJobFlowSteps(AddJobFlowStepsRequest) AddJobFlowSteps operation}.
 * <p>
 * AddJobFlowSteps adds new steps to a running job flow. A maximum of
 * 256 steps are allowed in each job flow.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A step specifies the location of a JAR file stored either on the
 * master node of the job flow or in Amazon S3. Each step is performed by
 * the main function of the main class of the JAR file. The main class
 * can be specified either in the manifest of the JAR or by using the
 * MainFunction parameter of the step.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Elastic MapReduce executes each step in the order listed. For a step
 * to be considered complete, the main function must exit with a zero
 * exit code and all Hadoop jobs started while the step was running must
 * have completed and run successfully.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can only add steps to a job flow that is in one of the following
 * states: STARTING, BOOTSTAPPING, RUNNING, or WAITING.
 * </p>
