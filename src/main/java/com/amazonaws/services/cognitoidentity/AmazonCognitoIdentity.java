/**
 * Interface for accessing AmazonCognitoIdentity.
 * Amazon Cognito <p>
 * Amazon Cognito is a web service that facilitates the delivery of
 * scoped, temporary credentials to mobile devices or other untrusted
 * environments. Amazon Cognito uniquely identifies a device or user and
 * supplies the user with a consistent identity throughout the lifetime
 * of an application.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon Cognito lets users authenticate with third-party identity
 * providers (Facebook, Google, or Login with Amazon). As a developer,
 * you decide which identity providers to trust. You can also choose to
 * support unauthenticated access from your application. Your users are
 * provided with Cognito tokens that uniquely identify their device and
 * any information provided about third-party logins.
