/**
 * Container for the parameters to the {@link com.amazonaws.services.securitytoken.AWSSecurityTokenService#assumeRole(AssumeRoleRequest) AssumeRole operation}.
 * <p>
 * Returns a set of temporary security credentials (consisting of an
 * access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token) that you can
 * use to access AWS resources that you might not normally have access
 * to. Typically, you use <code>AssumeRole</code> for cross-account
 * access or federation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Important:</b> You cannot call <code>AssumeRole</code> by using
 * AWS account credentials; access will be denied. You must use IAM user
 * credentials or temporary security credentials to call
 * <code>AssumeRole</code> .
 * 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For cross-account access, imagine that you own multiple accounts and
 * need to access resources in each account. You could create long-term
 * credentials in each account to access those resources. However,
 * managing all those credentials and remembering which one can access
 * which account can be time consuming. Instead, you can create one set
 * of long-term credentials in one account and then use temporary
 * security credentials to access all the other accounts by assuming
 * roles in those accounts. For more information about roles, see
 * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/WorkingWithRoles.html"> Roles </a>
 * in <i>Using IAM</i> .
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For federation, you can, for example, grant single sign-on access to
 * the AWS Management Console. If you already have an identity and
 * authentication system in your corporate network, you don't have to
 * recreate user identities in AWS in order to grant those user
 * identities access to AWS. Instead, after a user has been
 * authenticated, you call <code>AssumeRole</code> (and specify the role
 * with the appropriate permissions) to get temporary security
 * credentials for that user. With those temporary security credentials,
 * you construct a sign-in URL that users can use to access the console.
 * For more information, see
 * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/UsingSTS/STSUseCases.html"> Scenarios for Granting Temporary Access </a>
 * in <i>AWS Security Token Service</i> .
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The temporary security credentials are valid for the duration that
 * you specified when calling <code>AssumeRole</code> , which can be from
 * 900 seconds (15 minutes) to 3600 seconds (1 hour). The default is 1
 * hour.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Optionally, you can pass an AWS IAM access policy to this operation.
 * The temporary security credentials that are returned by the operation
 * have the permissions that are associated with the access policy of the
 * role that is being assumed, except for any permissions explicitly
 * denied by the policy you pass. This gives you a way to further
 * restrict the permissions for the resulting temporary security
 * credentials. These policies and any applicable resource-based policies
 * are evaluated when calls to AWS are made using the temporary security
 * credentials.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To assume a role, your AWS account must be trusted by the role. The
 * trust relationship is defined in the role's trust policy when the IAM
 * role is created. You must also have a policy that allows you to call
 * <code>sts:AssumeRole</code> .
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Using MFA with AssumeRole</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can optionally include multi-factor authentication (MFA)
 * information when you call <code>AssumeRole</code> . This is useful for
 * cross-account scenarios in which you want to make sure that the user
 * who is assuming the role has been authenticated using an AWS MFA
 * device. In that scenario, the trust policy of the role being assumed
 * includes a condition that tests for MFA authentication; if the caller
 * does not include valid MFA information, the request to assume the role
 * is denied. The condition in a a trust policy that tests for MFA
 * authentication might look like the following example.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>"Condition": {"Null": {"aws:MultiFactorAuthAge": false}}</code>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For more information, see
 * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/MFAProtectedAPI.html"> Configuring MFA-Protected API Access </a>
 * in the <i>Using AWS IAM</i> guide.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To use MFA with <code>AssumeRole</code> , you pass values for the
 * <code>SerialNumber</code> and <code>TokenCode</code> parameters. The
 * <code>SerialNumber</code> value identifies the user's hardware or
 * virtual MFA device. The <code>TokenCode</code> is the temporary
 * one-time password (TOTP) that the MFA devices produces.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * </p>
 * <p>
