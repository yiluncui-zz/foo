/**
 * Container for the parameters to the {@link com.amazonaws.services.securitytoken.AWSSecurityTokenService#assumeRoleWithSAML(AssumeRoleWithSAMLRequest) AssumeRoleWithSAML operation}.
 * <p>
 * Returns a set of temporary security credentials for users who have
 * been authenticated via a SAML authentication response. This operation
 * provides a mechanism for tying an enterprise identity store or
 * directory to role-based AWS access without user-specific credentials
 * or configuration.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The temporary security credentials returned by this operation consist
 * of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token.
 * Applications can use these temporary security credentials to sign
 * calls to AWS services. The credentials are valid for the duration that
 * you specified when calling <code>AssumeRoleWithSAML</code> , which can
 * be up to 3600 seconds (1 hour) or until the time specified in the SAML
 * authentication response's <code>NotOnOrAfter</code> value, whichever
 * is shorter.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b>The maximum duration for a session is 1 hour, and the
 * minimum duration is 15 minutes, even if values outside this range are
 * specified.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Optionally, you can pass an AWS IAM access policy to this operation.
 * The temporary security credentials that are returned by the operation
 * have the permissions that are associated with the access policy of the
 * role being assumed, except for any permissions explicitly denied by
 * the policy you pass. This gives you a way to further restrict the
 * permissions for the resulting temporary security credentials. These
 * policies and any applicable resource-based policies are evaluated when
 * calls to AWS are made using the temporary security credentials.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Before your application can call <code>AssumeRoleWithSAML</code> ,
 * you must configure your SAML identity provider (IdP) to issue the
 * claims required by AWS. Additionally, you must use AWS Identity and
 * Access Management (AWS IAM) to create a SAML provider entity in your
 * AWS account that represents your identity provider, and create an AWS
 * IAM role that specifies this SAML provider in its trust policy.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithSAML</code> does not require the use of
 * AWS security credentials. The identity of the caller is validated by
 * using keys in the metadata document that is uploaded for the SAML
 * provider entity for your identity provider.
