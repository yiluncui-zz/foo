/**
 * Client for accessing AWSSecurityTokenService.  All service calls made
 * using this client are blocking, and will not return until the service call
 * completes.
 * <p>
 * AWS Security Token Service <p>
 * The AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) is a web service that
 * enables you to request temporary, limited-privilege credentials for
 * AWS Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM) users or for users that
 * you authenticate (federated users). This guide provides descriptions
 * of the AWS STS API. For more detailed information about using this
 * service, go to
 * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UsingSTS/Welcome.html"> Using Temporary Security Credentials </a>
 * .
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> As an alternative to using the API, you can use one of
 * the AWS SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code for various
 * programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android,
 * etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access
 * to AWS STS. For example, the SDKs take care of cryptographically
 * signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests
 * automatically. For information about the AWS SDKs, including how to
 * download and install them, see the Tools for Amazon Web Services page.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For information about setting up signatures and authorization through
 * the API, go to
 * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html"> Signing AWS API Requests </a> in the <i>AWS General Reference</i> . For general information about the Query API, go to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAM_UsingQueryAPI.html"> Making Query Requests </a> in <i>Using IAM</i> .

 * <p>
 * <b>Recording API requests</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * AWS STS supports AWS CloudTrail, which is a service that records AWS
 * calls for your AWS account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3
 * bucket. By using information collected by CloudTrail, you can
 * determine what requests were successfully made to AWS STS, who made
 * the request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more about
 * CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see
 * the
 * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/whatisawscloudtrail.html"> AWS CloudTrail User Guide </a>

     * The <code>GetSessionToken</code> action must be called by using the
     * long-term AWS security credentials of the AWS account or an IAM user.

     * that you specify, between 900 seconds (15 minutes) and 129600 seconds

     * provider, such as Login with Amazon, Facebook, or Google.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> does not require the
     * use of AWS security credentials. Therefore, you can distribute an
     * application (for example, on mobile devices) that requests temporary
     * security credentials without including long-term AWS credentials in
     * the application, and without deploying server-based proxy services
     * that use long-term AWS credentials. Instead, the identity of the
     * caller is validated by using a token from the web identity provider.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The temporary security credentials returned by this API consist of an
     * access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Applications
     * can use these temporary security credentials to sign calls to AWS
     * service APIs. The credentials are valid for the duration that you
     * specified when calling <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> , which
     * can be from 900 seconds (15 minutes) to 3600 seconds (1 hour). By
     * default, the temporary security credentials are valid for 1 hour.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Optionally, you can pass an AWS IAM access policy to this operation.
     * The temporary security credentials that are returned by the operation
     * have the permissions that are associated with the access policy of the
     * role being assumed, except for any permissions explicitly denied by
     * the policy you pass. This gives you a way to further restrict the
     * permissions for the resulting temporary security credentials. These
     * policies and any applicable resource-based policies are evaluated when
     * calls to AWS are made using the temporary security credentials.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Before your application can call
     * <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> , you must have an identity
     * token from a supported identity provider and create a role that the
     * application can assume. The role that your application assumes must
     * trust the identity provider that is associated with the identity
     * token. In other words, the identity provider must be specified in the
     * role's trust policy.

     * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/WorkingWithRoles.html"> Roles </a>
     * in <i>Using IAM</i> .
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For federation, you can, for example, grant single sign-on access to
     * the AWS Management Console. If you already have an identity and
     * authentication system in your corporate network, you don't have to
     * recreate user identities in AWS in order to grant those user
     * identities access to AWS. Instead, after a user has been
     * authenticated, you call <code>AssumeRole</code> (and specify the role
     * with the appropriate permissions) to get temporary security
     * credentials for that user. With those temporary security credentials,
     * you construct a sign-in URL that users can use to access the console.
     * For more information, see
     * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/UsingSTS/STSUseCases.html"> Scenarios for Granting Temporary Access </a>
     * in <i>AWS Security Token Service</i> .
     * </p>
     * <p>

     * hour.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Optionally, you can pass an AWS IAM access policy to this operation.
     * The temporary security credentials that are returned by the operation

     * are evaluated when calls to AWS are made using the temporary security
     * credentials.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * To assume a role, your AWS account must be trusted by the role. The
     * trust relationship is defined in the role's trust policy when the IAM
     * role is created. You must also have a policy that allows you to call

     * <p>
     * <b>Using MFA with AssumeRole</b>
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You can optionally include multi-factor authentication (MFA)
     * information when you call <code>AssumeRole</code> . This is useful for
     * cross-account scenarios in which you want to make sure that the user
     * who is assuming the role has been authenticated using an AWS MFA
     * device. In that scenario, the trust policy of the role being assumed
     * includes a condition that tests for MFA authentication; if the caller
     * does not include valid MFA information, the request to assume the role
     * is denied. The condition in a a trust policy that tests for MFA
     * authentication might look like the following example.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <code>"Condition": {"Null": {"aws:MultiFactorAuthAge": false}}</code>

     * </p>
     * <p>
     * To use MFA with <code>AssumeRole</code> , you pass values for the
