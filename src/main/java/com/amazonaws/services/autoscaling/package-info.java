 * Synchronous and asynchronous client classes for accessing AmazonAutoScaling.
 *
 * <p>
 * Amazon Auto Scaling is an easy-to-use web service designed to
 * automatically launch or terminate EC2 instances based on user defined
 * triggers. Users can set up Auto Scaling groups and associate triggers
 * with these groups to automatically scale computing resources based on
 * parameters such as bandwidth usage or CPU utilization. Auto Scaling
 * groups can work across multiple Availability Zones - distinct physical
 * locations for the hosted EC2 instances - so that if an Availability
 * Zone becomes unhealthy or unavailable, Auto Scaling will automatically
 * re-distribute applications to a healthy Availability Zone.
