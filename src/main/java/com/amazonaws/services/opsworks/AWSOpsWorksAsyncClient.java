/**
 * Asynchronous client for accessing AWSOpsWorks.
 * All asynchronous calls made using this client are non-blocking. Callers could either
 * process the result and handle the exceptions in the worker thread by providing a callback handler
 * when making the call, or use the returned Future object to check the result of the call in the calling thread.
 * AWS OpsWorks <p>
 * Welcome to the <i>AWS OpsWorks API Reference</i> . This guide provides
 * descriptions, syntax, and usage examples about AWS OpsWorks actions
 * and data types, including common parameters and error codes.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * AWS OpsWorks is an application management service that provides an
 * integrated experience for overseeing the complete application
 * lifecycle. For information about this product, go to the
 * <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/opsworks/"> AWS OpsWorks </a>
 * details page.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>SDKs and CLI</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The most common way to use the AWS OpsWorks API is by using the AWS
 * Command Line Interface (CLI) or by using one of the AWS SDKs to
 * implement applications in your preferred language. For more
 * information, see:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html"> AWS CLI </a>
 * </li>

 * 
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <b>Endpoints</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * AWS OpsWorks supports only one endpoint,
 * opsworks.us-east-1.amazonaws.com (HTTPS), so you must connect to that
 * endpoint. You can then use the API to direct AWS OpsWorks to create
 * stacks in any AWS Region.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Chef Version</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When you call CreateStack, CloneStack, or UpdateStack we recommend you
 * use the <code>ConfigurationManager</code> parameter to specify the
 * Chef version, 0.9, 11.4, or 11.10. The default value is currently
 * 11.4. For more information, see
 * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/workingcookbook-chef11.html"> Chef Versions </a>
