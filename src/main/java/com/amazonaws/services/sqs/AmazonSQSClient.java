/**
 * Client for accessing AmazonSQS.  All service calls made

 * completes.
 * <p>
 * Amazon Simple Queue Service <p>
 * Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) offers a reliable, highly
 * scalable, hosted queue for storing messages as they travel between
 * computers. By using Amazon SQS, developers can simply move data
 * between distributed components of their applications that perform
 * different tasks, without losing messages or requiring each component
 * to be always available. Amazon SQS makes it easy to build an automated
 * workflow, working in close conjunction with the Amazon Elastic Compute
 * Cloud (Amazon EC2) and the other AWS infrastructure web services.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon SQS works by exposing Amazon's web-scale messaging
 * infrastructure as a web service. Any computer on the Internet can add
 * or read messages without any installed software or special firewall
 * configurations. Components of applications using Amazon SQS can run
 * independently, and do not need to be on the same network, developed
 * with the same technologies, or running at the same time.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Visit <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sqs/">
 * http://aws.amazon.com/sqs/ </a> for more information.

     * visibility timeout, see Visibility Timeout in the Amazon SQS Developer
     * Guide.)
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For example, let's say you have a message and its default message
     * visibility timeout is 30 minutes. You could call
     * ChangeMessageVisiblity with a value of two hours and the effective
     * timeout would be two hours and 30 minutes. When that time comes near
