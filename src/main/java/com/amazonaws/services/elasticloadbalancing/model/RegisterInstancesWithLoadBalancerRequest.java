/**
 * Container for the parameters to the {@link com.amazonaws.services.elasticloadbalancing.AmazonElasticLoadBalancing#registerInstancesWithLoadBalancer(RegisterInstancesWithLoadBalancerRequest) RegisterInstancesWithLoadBalancer operation}.
 * <p>
 * Adds new instances to the load balancer.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Once the instance is registered, it starts receiving traffic and
 * requests from the load balancer. Any instance that is not in any of
 * the Availability Zones registered for the load balancer will be moved
 * to the <i>OutOfService</i> state. It will move to the <i>InService</i>
 * state when the Availability Zone is added to the load balancer.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When an instance registered with a load balancer is stopped and then
 * restarted, the IP addresses associated with the instance changes.
 * Elastic Load Balancing cannot recognize the new IP address, which
 * prevents it from routing traffic to the instances. We recommend that
 * you de-register your Amazon EC2 instances from your load balancer
 * after you stop your instance, and then register the load balancer with
 * your instance after you've restarted. To de-register your instances
 * from load balancer, use DeregisterInstancesFromLoadBalancer action.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For more information, see
 * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/US_DeReg_Reg_Instances.html"> De-register and Register Amazon EC2 Instances </a>
 * in the <i>Elastic Load Balancing Developer Guide</i> .
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> In order for this call to be successful, you must provide
 * the same account credentials as those that were used to create the
 * load balancer.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> Completion of this API does not guarantee that operation
 * has completed. Rather, it means that the request has been registered
 * and the changes will happen shortly.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can use DescribeLoadBalancers or DescribeInstanceHealth action to
 * check the state of the newly registered instances.
