 * Container for the parameters to the {@link com.amazonaws.services.identitymanagement.AmazonIdentityManagement#uploadSigningCertificate(UploadSigningCertificateRequest) UploadSigningCertificate operation}.
 * <p>
 * Uploads an X.509 signing certificate and associates it with the
 * specified User. Some AWS services use X.509 signing certificates to
 * validate requests that are signed with a corresponding private key.
 * When you upload the certificate, its default status is
 * <code>Active</code> .
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If the <code>UserName</code> field is not specified, the User name is
 * determined implicitly based on the AWS Access Key ID used to sign the
 * request. Because this action works for access keys under the AWS
 * Account, this API can be used to manage root credentials even if the
 * AWS Account has no associated Users.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b>Because the body of a X.509 certificate can be large, you
 * should use POST rather than GET when calling UploadSigningCertificate.
 * For more information, see Making Query Requests in Using AWS Identity
 * and Access Management.
