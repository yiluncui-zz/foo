 * Client for accessing AmazonIdentityManagement.  All calls made
 * using this client are non-blocking and will immediately return a Java Future.
 * Callers must use the Future object to determine when the service call has actually

 * AWS Identity and Access Management <p>
 * AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that enables
 * Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers to manage users and user
 * permissions under their AWS account.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This is the AWS Identity and Access Management API Reference. This
 * guide describes who should read this guide and other resources related
 * to IAM.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Use of this guide assumes you are familiar with the following:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>Basic understanding of web services (for information, go to W3
 * Schools Web Services Tutorial at <a
 * href="http://www.w3schools.com/webservices/default.asp">
 * http://www.w3schools.com/webservices/default.asp </a> ).</li>
 * <li>XML (for information, go to W3 Schools XML Tutorial at <a
 * href="http://www.w3schools.com/xml/default.asp">
 * http://www.w3schools.com/xml/default.asp </a> ).</li>
 * <li>JSON (for information, go to <a href="http://json.org">
 * http://json.org </a> )</li>
 * <li>The specific AWS products you are using or plan to use (e.g.,
 * Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Simple Storage
 * Service (Amazon S3), etc.)</li>
 * 
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * If you're new to AWS and need additional technical information about a
