/**
 * Container for the parameters to the {@link com.amazonaws.services.ec2.AmazonEC2#createCustomerGateway(CreateCustomerGatewayRequest) CreateCustomerGateway operation}.
 * <p>
 * Provides information to AWS about your customer gateway device. The
 * customer gateway is the appliance at your end of the VPN connection
 * (compared to the VPN gateway, which is the device at the AWS side of
 * the VPN connection). You can have a single active customer gateway per
 * AWS account (active means that you've created a VPN connection to use
 * with the customer gateway). AWS might delete any customer gateway that
 * you create with this operation if you leave it inactive for an
 * extended period of time.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You must provide the Internet-routable IP address of the customer
 * gateway's external interface. The IP address must be static.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You must also provide the device's Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
 * Autonomous System Number (ASN). You can use an existing ASN assigned
 * to your network. If you don't have an ASN already, you can use a
 * private ASN (in the 64512 - 65534 range). For more information about
 * ASNs, go to <a
 * href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_%28Internet%29.">
