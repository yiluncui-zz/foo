 * Deletes a VPN connection. Use this if you want to delete a VPC and
 * all its associated components. Another reason to use this operation is
 * if you believe the tunnel credentials for your VPN connection have
 * been compromised. In that situation, you can delete the VPN connection
 * and create a new one that has new keys, without needing to delete the
 * VPC or VPN gateway. If you create a new VPN connection, you must
 * reconfigure the customer gateway using the new configuration
 * information returned with the new VPN connection ID.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you're deleting the VPC and all its associated parts, we recommend
 * you detach the VPN gateway from the VPC and delete the VPC before
 * deleting the VPN connection.
