/**
 * Container for the parameters to the {@link com.amazonaws.services.ec2.AmazonEC2#createVpnConnection(CreateVpnConnectionRequest) CreateVpnConnection operation}.
 * <p>
 * Creates a new VPN connection between an existing VPN gateway and
 * customer gateway. The only supported connection type is ipsec.1.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The response includes information that you need to configure your
 * customer gateway, in XML format. We recommend you use the command line
 * version of this operation (ec2-create-vpn-connection), which takes an
 * -f option (for format) and returns configuration information formatted
 * as expected by the vendor you specified, or in a generic, human
 * readable format. For information about the command, go to
 * ec2-create-vpn-connection in the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud Command
 * Line Reference.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>IMPORTANT:</b> We strongly recommend you use HTTPS when calling
 * this operation because the response contains sensitive cryptographic
 * information for configuring your customer gateway. If you decide to
 * shut down your VPN connection for any reason and then create a new
 * one, you must re-configure your customer gateway with the new
 * information returned from this call.
 * </p>
