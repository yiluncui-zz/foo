     * <b>NOTE:</b> BatchWriteItem cannot update items. To update items, use

     * The individual <i>PutItem</i> and <i>DeleteItem</i> operations
     * specified in <i>BatchWriteItem</i> are atomic; however
     * <i>BatchWriteItem</i> as a whole is not. If any requested operations
     * fail because the table's provisioned throughput is exceeded or an
     * internal processing failure occurs, the failed operations are returned
     * in the <i>UnprocessedItems</i> response parameter. You can investigate
     * and optionally resend the requests. Typically, you would call
     * <i>BatchWriteItem</i> in a loop. Each iteration would check for
     * unprocessed items and submit a new <i>BatchWriteItem</i> request with
     * those unprocessed items until all items have been processed.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * To write one item, you can use the <i>PutItem</i> operation; to delete
     * one item, you can use the <i>DeleteItem</i> operation.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * With <i>BatchWriteItem</i> , you can efficiently write or delete large
     * amounts of data, such as from Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR), or copy
     * data from another database into Amazon DynamoDB. In order to improve
     * performance with these large-scale operations, <i>BatchWriteItem</i>
     * does not behave in the same way as individual <i>PutItem</i> and
     * <i>DeleteItem</i> calls would For example, you cannot specify
     * conditions on individual put and delete requests, and
     * <i>BatchWriteItem</i> does not return deleted items in the response.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If you use a programming language that supports concurrency, such as
     * Java, you can use threads to write items in parallel. Your application
     * must include the necessary logic to manage the threads.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * With languages that don't support threading, such as PHP,
     * <i>BatchWriteItem</i> will write or delete the specified items one at
     * a time. In both situations, <i>BatchWriteItem</i> provides an
     * alternative where the API performs the specified put and delete
     * operations in parallel, giving you the power of the thread pool
     * approach without having to introduce complexity into your application.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Parallel processing reduces latency, but each specified put and delete
     * request consumes the same number of write capacity units whether it is
     * processed in parallel or not. Delete operations on nonexistent items
     * consume one write capacity unit.
     * </p>

     * update. Valid values for <i>Action</i> are <code>PUT</code>,

     * <b>If an item with the specified <i>Key</i> is found in the table:</b>

     * mathematically added to the existing attribute. If <i>Value</i> is a

     * <note> <p> If you use <code>ADD</code> to increment or decrement a

     * DynamoDB uses <code>0</code> as the initial value. For example,

     * attribute named <i>itemcount</i>, but you decide to <code>ADD</code>
     * the number <code>3</code> to this attribute anyway, even though it
     * currently does not exist. Amazon DynamoDB will create the
     * <i>itemcount</i> attribute, set its initial value to <code>0</code>,
     * and finally add <code>3</code> to it. The result will be a new
     * <i>itemcount</i> attribute in the item, with a value of
     * <code>3</code>. </note> </li> <li> <p>If the existing data type is a
     * set, and if the <i>Value</i> is also a set, then the <i>Value</i> is
