 * Synchronous and asynchronous client classes for accessing AmazonRDS.
 *
 * Amazon Relational Database Service <p>
 * Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that
 * makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in
 * the cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizable capacity for an
 * industry-standard relational database and manages common database
 * administration tasks, freeing up developers to focus on what makes
 * their applications and businesses unique.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon RDS gives you access to the capabilities of a familiar MySQL
 * database server. This means the code, applications, and tools you
 * already use today with your existing MySQL databases work with Amazon
 * RDS without modification. Amazon RDS automatically backs up your
 * database and maintains the database software that powers your DB
 * Instance. Amazon RDS is flexible: you can scale your database
 * instance's compute resources and storage capacity to meet your
 * application's demand. As with all Amazon Web Services, there are no
 * up-front investments, and you pay only for the resources you use.
 * </p>
