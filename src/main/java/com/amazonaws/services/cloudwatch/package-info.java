/**
 * Synchronous and asynchronous client classes for accessing AmazonCloudWatch.
 *
 * <p>
 * Amazon CloudWatch is a web service that enables you to monitor and
 * manage various metrics, as well as configure alarm actions based on
 * data from metrics.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon CloudWatch monitoring enables you to collect, analyze, and view
 * system and application metrics so that you can make operational and
 * business decisions more quickly and with greater confidence. You can
 * use Amazon CloudWatch to collect metrics about your AWS resources,
 * such as the performance of your Amazon EC2 instances.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you are registered for an AWS product that supports Amazon
 * CloudWatch, the service automatically pushes basic metrics to
 * CloudWatch for you. Once Amazon CloudWatch contains metrics, you can
 * calculate statistics based on that data.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon CloudWatch alarms help you implement decisions more easily by
 * enabling you do things like send notifications or automatically make
 * changes to the resources you are monitoring, based on rules that you
 * define. For example, you can create alarms that initiate Auto Scaling
 * and Simple Notification Service actions on your behalf.
 * </p>
