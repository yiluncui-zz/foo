 * This guide is for programmers who need detailed information about the CloudFormation APIs. You use AWS CloudFormation to create and manage AWS
 * infrastructure deployments predictably and repeatedly. CloudFormation helps you leverage AWS products such as Amazon EC2, EBS, Amazon SNS, ELB, and
 * Auto Scaling to build highly-reliable, highly scalable, cost effective applications without worrying about creating and configuring the underlying the
 * AWS infrastructure.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Through the use of a template file you write, and a few AWS CloudFormation commands or API actions, AWS CloudFormation enables you to manage a
 * collection of resources together as a single unit called a stack. AWS CloudFormation creates and deletes all member resources of the stack together
 * and manages all dependencies between the resources for you.
