/**
 * Client for accessing AmazonCloudFormation.  All calls made
 * using this client are non-blocking and will immediately return a Java Future.
 * Callers must use the Future object to determine when the service call has actually
 * completed.
 * AWS CloudFormation <p>
 * This is the AWS CloudFormation API Reference. The major sections of
 * this guide are described in the following table.
 * </p>
 * Actions Alphabetical list of CloudFormation actions Data Types
 * Alphabetical list of CloudFormation data types Common Parameters
 * Parameters that all Query actions can use Common Errors Client and
 * server errors that all actions can return <p>
 * This guide is for programmers who need detailed information about the
 * CloudFormation APIs. You use AWS CloudFormation to create and manage
 * AWS infrastructure deployments predictably and repeatedly.
 * CloudFormation helps you leverage AWS products such as Amazon EC2,
 * EBS, Amazon SNS, ELB, and Auto Scaling to build highly-reliable,
 * highly scalable, cost effective applications without worrying about
 * creating and configuring the underlying the AWS infrastructure.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Through the use of a template file you write, and a few AWS
 * CloudFormation commands or API actions, AWS CloudFormation enables you
 * to manage a collection of resources together as a single unit called a
 * stack. AWS CloudFormation creates and deletes all member resources of
 * the stack together and manages all dependencies between the resources
 * for you.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For more information about this product, go to the <a
 * href="http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/cloudformation">
 * CloudFormation Product Page </a> .
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon CloudFormation makes use of other AWS products. If you need
 * additional technical information about a specific AWS product, you can
 * find the product's technical documentation at
 * http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/.
