/**
 * Interface for accessing AWSCloudTrail.
 * AWS Cloud Trail <p>
 * This is the CloudTrail API Reference. It provides descriptions of
 * actions, data types, common parameters, and common errors for
 * CloudTrail.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * CloudTrail is a web service that records AWS API calls for your AWS
 * account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. The recorded
 * information includes the identity of the user, the start time of the
 * AWS API call, the source IP address, the request parameters, and the
 * response elements returned by the service.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> As an alternative to using the API, you can use one of
 * the AWS SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code for various
 * programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android,
 * etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access
 * to AWSCloudTrail. For example, the SDKs take care of cryptographically
 * signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests
 * automatically. For information about the AWS SDKs, including how to
 * download and install them, see the Tools for Amazon Web Services page.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * See the CloudTrail User Guide for information about the data that is
 * included with each AWS API call listed in the log files.
 * </p>
