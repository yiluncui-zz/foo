/**
 * Container for the parameters to the {@link com.amazonaws.services.kinesis.AmazonKinesis#putRecord(PutRecordRequest) PutRecord operation}.
 * <p>
 * Puts (writes) a single data record from a producer into an Amazon
 * Kinesis stream. Call <code>PutRecord</code> to send data from the
 * producer into the Amazon Kinesis stream for real-time ingestion and
 * subsequent processing, one record at a time. Each shard can support up
 * to 1000 records written per second, up to a maximum total of 1 MB data
 * written per second.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You must specify the name of the stream that captures, stores, and
 * transports the data; a partition key; and the data blob itself.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The data blob can be any type of data; for example, a segment from a
 * log file, geographic/location data, website clickstream data, and so
 * on.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The partition key is used by Amazon Kinesis to distribute data across
 * shards. Amazon Kinesis segregates the data records that belong to a
 * data stream into multiple shards, using the partition key associated
 * with each data record to determine which shard a given data record
 * belongs to.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Partition keys are Unicode strings, with a maximum length limit of 256
 * bytes. An MD5 hash function is used to map partition keys to 128-bit
 * integer values and to map associated data records to shards using the
 * hash key ranges of the shards. You can override hashing the partition
 * key to determine the shard by explicitly specifying a hash value using
 * the <code>ExplicitHashKey</code> parameter. For more information, see
 * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/kinesis-using-api-java.html#kinesis-using-api-defn-partition-key"> Partition Key </a>
 * in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Developer Guide</i> .
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>PutRecord</code> returns the shard ID of where the data record
 * was placed and the sequence number that was assigned to the data
 * record.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Sequence numbers generally increase over time. To guarantee strictly
 * increasing ordering, use the <code>SequenceNumberForOrdering</code>
 * parameter. For more information, see
 * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/kinesis-using-api-java.html#kinesis-using-api-defn-sequence-number"> Sequence Number </a>
 * in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Developer Guide</i> .
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If a <code>PutRecord</code> request cannot be processed because of
 * insufficient provisioned throughput on the shard involved in the
 * request, <code>PutRecord</code> throws
 * <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code> .
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Data records are accessible for only 24 hours from the time that they
 * are added to an Amazon Kinesis stream.
 * </p>
 *
 * @see com.amazonaws.services.kinesis.AmazonKinesis#putRecord(PutRecordRequest)
